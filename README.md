# Dialog System Technology Challenges 7 (DSTC 7)

## Track 1 - Sentence Selection
This challenge is offered using two goal oriented dialog datasets and consists of 5 subtasks which are described below. A participant may participate in one, several or all the subtasks. The general goal of the track is that *given a partial conversation, select the correct next utterances from a set of candidates* and even indicate that none of the proposed utterances is a good candidate. The objective is to push the utterance classification towards real world problems.

A full description of the track is available [here](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/proposals/DSTC%207%20Task%20Description%20-%20NOESIS_final.pdf "here").
